Lemon is an international shared electric vehicle company that operates in Portugal since 2018, both with electric scooters and electric bicycles.

Customers can look for and unlock these vehicles through a mobile app or a website, where they also perform the payment for the used services.

Lemon's employees also have an internal app to pick up wrongly parked vehicles, which has access to their location through GPS and suggests the best course with Google Maps integration.

Begin with an introductory paragraph that tells readers the purpose of your software and its major benefits.
Give them a summary of the information you will include in your ReadMe using clearly defined sections.

## General Information

This section expands on the introductory paragraph to give readers a better understanding of your project.
Include a brief description and answer the question, "what problem does this project solve?"

### Built With

-   [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - used for database
-   [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) - used to build every API

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What kind of **hardware** device and which **operating system** do you need to have to install the software.

In this section also include detailed instructions for installing additiona software the application is dependent upon (such as PostgreSQL database, for example).

To run our project we assume that any computer with [SEEDS labs](https://github.com/tecnico-sec/Setup/). Any other Operating System can be used with a similar setup flow.

You need Python3 and Postgresql that can be installed with
```
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install postgresql
```
Now that you have python, installing pip can help installing the libraries needed

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Finally you can install the libraries needed:
 ```
 pip install flask pyjwt Datetime secrets argon2-cffi hmac hashlib APScheduler
 ```

### Installing

Give step-by-step instructions on building and running the application on the development environment.

Describe the step.

```
Give the command example
```

And repeat.

```
until finished
```

You can also add screenshots to show expected results, when relevant.

### Testing

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

Give users explicit instructions on how to run all necessary tests.
Explain the libraries, such as JUnit, used for testing your software and supply all necessary commands.

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example command
```

## Demo

Give a tour of the best features of the application.
Add screenshots when relevant.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system e.g. a host or a cloud provider.

Mention virtualization/container tools and commands.

```
Give an example command
```

Provide instructions for connecting to servers and tell clients how to obtain necessary permissions.
